### **Smart Layers**
- [Forms]() - You can set up forms and enable visitors of the website to submit information such as their contact information
- [Embed Code]() - Embed HTML snippets that enhance your website functionality
- Fixed Position - Fixes components in one place while the rest of the content moves behind them on scrolling
- [Hover Effect]() - Animations that happen when a visitor hovers their mouse over a specific element
- Entrance Animation - Animation that is activated on scroll
- [Videos]() - You can embed a video player in the website. YouTube, Vimeo, MP4 or GIFs are all supported

1. Design your website in **Adobe XD** where each web page is represented by an artboard
2. Add **Links**, **Forms & Text Inputs**, **Videos**, **Hover Effects**, and more
3.  Create a preview website to verify that the website looks as desired
4. Publish!
