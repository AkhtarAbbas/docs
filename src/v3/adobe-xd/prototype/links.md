In **Adobe XD,** each artboard represents a webpage. You can create **Links** to connect different artboards (webpages).

There are four types of **Links**:

1. **Internal Link** - A link between different artboard 
2. **External Links** - A link to an external website
3. **Back Links** - A link that displays the previous screen
4. **Overlays** - A link that displays an artboard (webpage) over the existing one it was clicked from
 
## Internal Links

Internal Links are links between artboards of the same Adobe XD document.

**Using Adobe XD Prototype Triggers* **

When you create a **Tap** trigger **Transition** using Adobe XD, it automatically populates as an Anima Internal Link.

## External Links

1. Select the layer which will trigger the navigation event  (i.e.: a social media icon or email address).
2. Click **Link**  in the **Flow** section
3. Select **External Link** from the Link Type drop-down menu
4. Enter the full URL for the external website or enter 'mailto: info@example.com' to link to an email address

## Overlays
An **Overlay** is a link type that lets you display another artboard on top of the existing one rather than as a separate destination screen.  

**Using Adobe XD Prototype Triggers* **

When you create a **Tap** trigger **Overlay** using Adobe XD, it automatically populates as an Anima **Overlay**.
