In **Adobe XD,** each artboard represents a webpage. You can create **Links** to connect different artboards (webpages).

There are four types of **Links**:

1. **Internal Link** - A link between different artboard 
2. **External Links** - A link to an external website
3. **Back Links** - A link that displays the previous screen
4. **Overlays** - A link that displays an artboard (webpage) over the existing one it was clicked from
 
## Internal Links

Internal Links are links between artboards of the same Adobe XD document.

There are two ways to create Internal Links:


**1. Using Anima Links **

1. Select the layer that will trigger the navigation event (i.e.: a button or navigation link)
2. Click **Link**  in the **Flow** section
3. Select **Internal Link** in the Link Type drop-down menu (set by Default)
4. Select the target artboard in the drop-down menu

**2. Using Adobe XD Tap Transitions* **

When you create a **Tap** trigger **Transition** using Adobe XD, it automatically populates as an Anima Internal Link.

## External Links

Many times you want to create links to external websites that aren't a part of your website, for example,  links to Facebook, Twitter, App Stores, etc..

To create an **External Link**:

1. Select the layer which will trigger the navigation event  (i.e.: a social media icon or email address).
2. Click **Link**  in the **Flow** section
3. Select **External Link** from the Link Type drop-down menu
4. Enter the full URL for the external website or enter 'mailto: info@example.com' to link to an email address

## Overlays
An **Overlay** is a link type that lets you display another artboard on top of the existing one rather than as a separate destination screen.  

There are two ways to create an Overlay:


**1. Using Anima Links **

1. Select the layer that will trigger the **Overlay**
2. Click **Link**  in the **Flow** section
3. Select **Overlay** in the Link Type drop-down menu
4. From the Destination drop-down, select the artboard that you want to Overlay on top
