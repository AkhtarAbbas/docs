## How To Create Breakpoints

First, design your website in multiple artboards where each of the artboards represents the same webpage but for different screen size.

To mark different screen size artboard as the same webpage:

1. Select the artboard of one of the device screens, for example, **Home Desktop**
2. Click **Breakpoints** in the **Flow** sections
3. With the mouse, click on every artboard that represents the same web page but in a different device screen, for example, **Table Desktop**, **Mobile Desktop**
4. Click **Done** to apply the Breakpoints
