## How To Create Breakpoints

First, design your website in multiple artboards where each of the artboards represents the same webpage but for different screen size, for example, **Home Desktop, Home Tablet, Home Mobile**.


To mark different screen size artboard as the same webpage:

1. Select all artboards that you want to connect with breakpoints, for example, **Home Desktop, Home Tablet, Home Mobile**
2. Click **Breakpoints** in the **Flow** sections
3. Click **Done** to apply the Breakpoints

To Edit Breakpoints:
1. Select any artboard that has the breakpoint you want to edit
2. From the Plugin panel, uncheck the box next to the breakpoint you want to edit
3. If you want to replace it with a different breakpoint, select all artboards that you want to connect with breakpoints again
4. Click **Done** to apply the Breakpoints
