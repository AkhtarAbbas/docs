## Introduction

With Anima, you can embed  **Videos** and **GIFs** in your website right from Adobe XD. 

**Videos** can be in the form of a video player or simply a cover/hero video without any control buttons.

Supported **Video** links are:

* YouTube
* Vimeo
* MP4
* GIF

The embedded video player can have these settings:

* Auto Play
* Loop
* No Control Buttons
* Cover (Fill rectangle)

## How To Embed Videos and GIFs

To embed a video or GIF to your website:

 1. Select the layer that will become the video or GIF
 2. Under the **Smart Layers** section, select **Video/GIF**
 3. Paste your video's or GIF URL
 4. Choose the **Playback Settings** you want: Auto Play, Loop, No Controls, Cover
 5. Save
 
To see it, click **Preview in Browser** in the Anima Panel.

❗️Note: YouTube and Vimeo do not allow to hide controls. We recommend to use the direct URL

## Files

If you want to embed locally stored files, go to your **Project Settings**, and in the **Files** tab, you can upload your videos/GIFs files from your computer and Anima will create a direct .mp4, .gif url that you can embed in the **Video/GIF** Smart Layer in Sketch.
