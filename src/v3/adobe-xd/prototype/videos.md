## How To Embed Videos and GIFs


To embed a video or GIF to your website:

 1. Select the layer that will become the video or GIF
 2. Under the **Smart Layers** section, select **Video/GIF**
 3. Paste your video's or GIF URL
 4. Choose the **Playback Settings** you want: Auto Play, Loop, No Controls, Cover
 5. Save
 
To see it, click **Preview in Browser** in the Anima Panel.

>❗️NOTE
>YouTube and Vimeo do not allow to hide controls. 
> For more control over your videos/GIFs, We recommend to use a direct .mp4 or .gif URL.

## Upload Local Files

If you want to embed locally stored files, go to your **Project Settings**, and in the **Files** tab, you can upload your videos/GIFs files from your computer and Anima will create a direct .mp4, .gif url that you can embed in the **Video/GIF** Smart Layer in Sketch.
