 **Flow** enables you to create both internal and external links between artboards (webpages).

There are 4 types of **Links**:

1. **Internal Link** - A link between different artboard 
2. **External Links** - A link to an external website
3. **Back Links** - A link that displays the previous screen
4. **Anchor Links** - A link within the same artboard 
 
## Internal Links

In **Adobe XD,** each artboard represents a webpage. You can create **Links** to connect different artboards (webpages):

1. Select the layer that will trigger the navigation event (i.e.: a button or navigation link)
2. Click **Link**  in the **Flow** section
3. Select **Internal Link** in the Link Type drop-down menu (set by Default)
4. Select the target artboard in the drop-down menu
