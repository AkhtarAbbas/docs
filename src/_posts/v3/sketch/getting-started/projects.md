-   **Team Projects** are where you can collaborate with others in your Organization. There can be multiple Projects in one team. Anyone added to the a Team can access these Projects. 
You can also invite Guests to a specific Project in a Team Projects and restrict them from accessing the other Projects (Share > Invite Guests).
